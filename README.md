This repository contains the exercises and projects completed during the [Codedex](https://www.codedex.io/@CrisU8) course — part of **The Origins Trilogy**, a series designed to teach the fundamentals of web development from the ground up.

Throughout this course, I learned the **core principles of HTML and basic CSS**, including semantic structure, form creation, and styling techniques.  
This repository showcases my progress and understanding of how to build and style functional, responsive web pages. It also features a final project that brings together all the key concepts covered.

## 🌍 What is HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to structure and display content on the web.  
It allows developers to define the elements of a web page such as:
- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Images
- Links
- Forms
- Layout containers (like sections, articles, headers)

- Headings
- Paragraphs

  We also had a brief introduction to styling these elements using CSS.

### ✍️ [Forms](./forms)

### 🧠 [Semantic HTML](./semantic-html)
In this section, we explored how to give **meaning and structure** to web pages using semantic tags like:
- `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`
- `<div>` and `<span>` for grouping content  
  These tags improve accessibility, SEO, and code organization.
